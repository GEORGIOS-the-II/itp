# Haiku Assingment 

### What I did:
- I made a recording of some lines of my favoutire poem in the haiku folder and then pushed it in to github for you to see

#### How I did it:

- I searched for one of my [favourite poems by Elizabeth Barerett Browning ](https://poets.org/poem/how-do-i-love-thee-sonnet-43). 

- Then I took the last four lines and pasted it into terminal after inputing the commands `pwd` then `cd Documents` and then `say -v "Samantha" "I love thee with a love I seemed to lose With my lost saints. I love thee with the breath, Smiles, tears, of all my life; and, if God choose, I shall but love thee better after death." -o haiku.aiff`

- Also, when trying to input a screenshot of terminal I found out that if i drag the png file straight into textmate it autmatically writes the whole sentence (code?) so i renamed it with the name i wanted it to have and did it way faster.  

#### Problems faced:

- The only thing was that my poem was pasted kind of wierdly with the spaces, and got stuck for a bit beacuse I didn't close the quotation marks,  but becides that all good :)
