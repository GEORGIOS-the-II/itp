# FizzBuzz Assingment

- I just used an elif, paid attention to the order, had to put the 3 and 5 modulo first, and then it worke.
- So the first if was the :

`(i % 3 === 0 && i % 5 === 0){
    console.log("FizzBuzz")`
	
- Then:

`else if(i % 3 === 0){
    console.log("Fizz")
    }`
	
- Then:

`else if(i % 5 === 0){
    console.log("Buzz")
    }`
	
- And finally to print the rest of the numbers just:

```else{console.log(`${i}`)}```

## I deleted some spacing because it showd up wierdly in the priview of the .md file.

- Thanks!!!!
