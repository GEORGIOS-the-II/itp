# Java Script Reading


## Chapter 1
 
 
 
### What I knew:
 
 - I knew how the binary system is used to produce the numbers with 64 bits(18 quintillion to be specific, that one I didnt know). 
 
### What I didnt know:
 
 - What all the different symbols mean and how they function, from arithmetic to the bigger smaller eqaul as well as question marks and exclamation points.
 
 
 
## Chapter 2



### What I knew:
 
 - To be honest I didnt know much from here on, I had an idea of what a binding, constant and var meant from our first classes.
 
### What I didnt know:

- What a switch was and how to use it for more efficient coding


## Chapter 3


### What I knew:

- Again, the only thing I could say I had a small idea about was functions.

### What I didnt know:

- Almost all of the stuff was new, one concept that I found most interesting was the Growing Functions and the customization that that provides.ÃŸ
