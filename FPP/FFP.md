# "NoGoBad" (i'll find a better title later)

## What is it?

An app that saves your food from going bad


## 3 SPECIFIC resources:

- [100DaysOfSwift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100)
- [Stanford's Online Class](https://cs193p.stanford.edu/2023)
- [Swift UI By Example](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/quick-start/swiftui)

## Details:

- An app that will log all of your groceries expiry date, and automatically notify you when its going to go bad. It can also have fixed information about the standard days that common grocerries are usually safe to consume. Its bassicaly going to use the phone's camera or by manualy inputing the expiry date, with the products name and maybe even image, and then through the calendar its going to automatically warn you, 3, 1, and same day about its expiration. Also, being ambitious, it would be nice to have a thing where it can automatically spot the often bought products and know their lifespan without having to input date, just by chosing the item from your catalog.

## Will any work as part of this project overlap with any work you are doing outside of this class? For another class? Who is the professor in this class?

- No :)

### A GOOD outcome for  final project:

- Manual input of expiration date, manual input of image for each product, one day before expiration notification.


### A BETTER outcome for  final project.

- Scan with camera the expiratino date, manually store often bought products and their average lifespan.

###  A BEST outcome for  final project. 

- Scan barcode of product to find its name and image, camera scan epixration date, notify 3, 1, and same day about expiration. 

## Outline of steps:

- Find which way im going to go about creating it. By 19/11

- Create all the basic parts of the app, manual date input, name of product. By 27/11

- Work on the user interface for the app, expiration notifications and try making it iphone useable. By 2/12

- Perfect all functions and if I have time get the extra functions in. By 11/12
